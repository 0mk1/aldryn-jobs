Basic usage

Create a django CMS page to hook the Aldryn Jobs application into. In its *Advanced settings*,
set its ``Application`` to *Jobs*, and use the provided, default *Jobs / aldryn_jobs* in
``Application configurations`` before saving.

The page is now a landing page for vacancies; it will be empty until you create some.

The behaviour of the Jobs system should be largely self-explanatory, but the :doc:`tutorial for
users </user/index>` will guide you through some basic steps if necessary.
