==================
Aldryn Jobs Add-On
==================

This add-on lets you:

- define translatable categories, which will appear in the menu
- add categorized, translatable job offers


Installation
============

Choose a site you want to install the add-on to from the dashboard. Then go to ``Apps -> Install app`` and click ``Install`` next to ``Jobs`` app.

Redeploy the site.

You can define categories and job offers now in the admin panel.

In order to display them, create a CMS page (e.g ``/jobs/``) and install the app there (choose ``Jobs`` from the ``Advanced Settings -> Application`` dropdown).

Now redeploy the site again.

The above CMS site has become a job offer listing.
