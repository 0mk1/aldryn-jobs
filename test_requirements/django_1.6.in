# ==========================================
# PLEASE NOTE:
# django CMS v3.2 requires django-formtools.
# Django-formtools was pulled out of Django
# 1.6 and into its own repo for Django 1.7.
# pip-compile doesn't like this, so, note
# that once requirements.txt are set, just
# change django CMS to version 3.2 or later
# if you like.
